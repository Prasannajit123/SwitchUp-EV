The primary objective of this case study is to develop a comprehensive analysis and provide next steps for a predictive model that accurately forecasts the residual value (RV) of used 2W vehicles.
Scope
•	Data Collection and Preprocessing: Utilize the provided cleaned data.
•	Statistical Analysis: Identify correlations between various factors and the residual value.
•	Hypothesis Development: Formulate and test hypotheses on factors affecting the RV.
•	Model Development: Provide steps for model development.
Data Provided
The dataset includes the following variables:
•	Mileage Run: Total kilometres driven.
•	Run Profile: Daily kilometres run based on mileage/(number of years * 300 days).
•	Brand: Manufacturer (e.g., Brand 1, 2, 3).
•	Model: Specific model (e.g., Model 1, 2, 3, 4).
•	Ownership: Number of previous owners.
•	City: Primary usage location of the vehicle.
•	Age: Vehicle age in years.
•	On-Road Price: Initial purchase price of the vehicle.
